Encapsulation (Data Hiding)
Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where the internal details (data and logic) of an object are hidden from the outside world. It is the process of bundling the object's data (attributes) and methods (functions) together into a single unit or class. The primary goal is to protect the internal state of an object from unintended modifications and provide controlled access to it.

Encapsulation enforces data hiding and ensures that attributes (variables) within a class are not directly accessible to other classes or external code. Instead, it provides getter and setter methods to access and modify these private attributes. By making attributes private, encapsulation maintains control over how the data is accessed and modified, preventing unwanted changes or access.


Importance of Encapsulation
There are several benefits of using Encapsulation which are as follows:
Data Security: The most significant benefit is data protection. Sensitive data can be hidden from external manipulation and can only be accessed or modified in a controlled manner.
Flexibility and Maintenance: If the internal implementation needs to change, encapsulation allows you to modify the code without affecting external code. You can alter the internal representation of the data or how it's accessed, as long as the public interface (methods) remains the same.
Modular Code: Encapsulation promotes cleaner, modular code by bundling related data and behaviors together. It helps in organizing the code, making it more readable and maintainable.
Improved Debugging and Testing: Since all access to an object's internal state is controlled, debugging and testing become easier. You can validate the behavior of methods (like getters and setters) independently.
Reduced Complexity: By hiding complex internal implementations and exposing only what is necessary, encapsulation simplifies the usage of objects and reduces the chances of errors in using the class.
