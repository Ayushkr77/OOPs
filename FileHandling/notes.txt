File handling in C++ is done using the fstream library, which provides three classes:
ifstream â€“ For reading files (input file stream)
ofstream â€“ For writing to files (output file stream)
fstream â€“ For both reading and writing





Importance of File Handling in OOPs:
File handling is crucial in Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) as it allows programs to interact with external data sources, enabling persistent data storage, communication, and configuration management. In the context of OOPs, file handling plays an even more powerful role by supporting modular, reusable, and extensible system design.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Logging
In object-oriented systems, file handling is often used to store log files. Logging helps track:
System behavior
Error messages
Debugging information
User activity
This makes it easier to debug and maintain OOP applications.
ðŸ§  Example: A Logger class can write error logs into a file when exceptions are caught.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Configuration Management
OOP systems often need flexibility in their behavior without changing code. File handling allows reading and writing from configuration files such as .ini, .json, or .xml.
ðŸ§  Example: A ConfigManager class can load settings like database credentials, theme preferences, etc., from a file.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Data Storage
Classes can save objects or records to a file, enabling persistence of object state.
Store user data
Save session info
Backup or archive important records
ðŸ§  Example: A User class might store user details in a file for later retrieval.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Object Serialization
In advanced file handling, OOP supports object serialization, which means converting objects into a format (like text or binary) that can be written to a file and reconstructed later.
ðŸ§  This is essential for applications like saving game states, user profiles, or document data.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Data Exchange Between Objects
Multiple objects or components of a system can exchange data via shared files, ensuring modular communication in a decoupled way.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Enhancing Real-World Modeling
Since OOP is about mimicking real-world entities, file handling allows the program to remember states, events, or transactions like a real-world system would.

âœ… Conclusion:
File handling in OOP is not just about input/outputâ€”it's about making your software realistic, persistent, and manageable. It complements core OOP principles like encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity by allowing objects to work with real-world data sources effectively.
